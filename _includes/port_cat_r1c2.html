        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project involves designing and implementing a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using VHDL. 
            The ALU includes arithmetic, logic, and shifting units. It uses two 16-bit data inputs (A and B), 
            a 1-bit mode input to select operation groups, and a 3-bit opcode to determine the specific operation. 
            Outputs include a 16-bit result (`ALU Out`) and a carry-out (`Cout`).
        </p>
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Arithmetic operations: Multiplication, addition, subtraction, and increment.</li>
            <li>Logical operations: NOR, NAND, OR, AND, XOR, XNOR, NOT A, and NOT B.</li>
            <li>Shifting operations: Shift left, shift right, rotate left, and rotate right.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ALU Design</h2>
        <p>
            The ALU uses several components, including an arithmetic unit, a logical unit, a shifter unit, and multiple 2:1 multiplexers. 
            The controller manages data flow based on the `mode` and `opcode` inputs. The system is structured to execute operations 
            based on the following control values:
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Mode</th>
                    <th>Opcode</th>
                    <th>Operation</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>000</td>
                    <td>A NOR B</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>001</td>
                    <td>A NAND B</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>000</td>
                    <td>A * B</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>011</td>
                    <td>Increment A</td>
                </tr>
                <!-- Additional rows as needed -->
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Test Bench and Results</h2>
        <p>
            The test bench simulates all 16 operations of the ALU. Key highlights include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Successful execution of logical operations like NOR and AND.</li>
            <li>Arithmetic operations including addition and multiplication.</li>
            <li>Shifting operations such as shift left and rotate right.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The test bench output confirms the ALU performs accurately based on mode and opcode combinations.
