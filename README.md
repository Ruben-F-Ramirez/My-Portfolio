# Creative Theme for Jekyll

A Jekyll implementation of the [Creative Theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/) template by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com).

I used the Jekyll theme as foundation for creating my own portfolio webpage.  This involved modifying the files within the theme and adding files to modify the page to include my projects and certifications.

# Skills 

In order to create my portfolio page I first needed to learn some basic HTML and CSS.  I spent some time creating very basic HTML structures for "Hello World" type pages.  After becoming comfortable with the HTML I began adding some CSS in a linked style sheet.
